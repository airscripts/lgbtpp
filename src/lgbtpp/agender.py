        self.description = "Agender, also known as genderless, is a gender identity that has been defined in several ways. It can mean having no gender at all (literal meaning) or not feeling a gender. Some people who identify as agender may experience gender neutrality, rejecting the gender binary of male/female, man/woman, or masculine/feminine. Others might not identify with any gender, finding the concept of gender irrelevant or choosing to reject it entirely. For some, rejecting the concept of gender is not just a personal choice, but a broader dismissal of gender as a whole."
